# Citibike Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to research and explore the data from Citibike in NYC and utilize the information to convince investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. One of the key stakeholders requested a bike trip analysis in order to back up the proposal and final decision. 

For this analysis, we'll start by using Pandas to convert the data from an integer to datatime datatype. 
Using the converted datatype, we'll create a set of visualizations shown in the results below. 

Visualizations:
1) Checkout Times for Users
2) Checkout Times by Gender
3) Trips by Weekday
4) Trips by Gender (Weekday per hour)
5) User Trips by Gender by Weekday
6) Toal Trips by Gender
7) Top Starting Locations by Users

## Results
